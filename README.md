# Legal Document Search API with Azure Cosmos DB Full-Text Search

## Description

This project demonstrates building a legal document search API using Nest.js integrated with Azure Cosmos DB's full-text search capabilities. It showcases how to implement intelligent document retrieval using BM25 scoring for relevance ranking.

## What is full-text search?
![alt text](./images/full-text-score.png)
Full-text search is a technique that finds specific information within a large corpus of text. It goes beyond keyword matching and analyzes the content of documents to identify relevant results based on the userâ€™s search query. 
Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL now offers a powerful Full Text Search feature in preview, designed to enhance the search capabilities of your applications. Read more about it here.
How does full-text search work?
A full-text search involves two primary stages:
- **Indexing**: The process of creating an index that maps terms to the documents in which they appear. This index is used to quickly locate documents that contain the search terms.
- **Searching**: The process of querying the index to retrieve relevant documents based on the search terms. The search engine ranks the documents based on their relevance to the query.
## Full-Text Search Features


- **BM25 Scoring**: Utilize advanced relevance scoring for document ranking
- **Term Frequency**: Consider how often search terms appear in documents
- **Document Length Normalization**: Account for varying document sizes
- **Inverse Document Frequency**: Weight terms based on their uniqueness

## Search Implementation

### Search Configuration
Required setup includes:
- Full-text indexing on text fields
- BM25 scoring configuration
- Query analyzers for text processing
- Composite indexes for efficient filtering

### Setup Requirements
1. Enable full-text search in Azure Cosmos DB
2. Configure text indexing policies
3. Implement search queries with BM25 scoring
4. Set up text analyzers for document processing
